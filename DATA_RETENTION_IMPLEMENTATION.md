# Data Retention Policy Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of data retention policies for the AI Interview System as part of Phase 1 security and compliance enhancements. The implementation ensures GDPR and CCPA compliance through automated data lifecycle management.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Data Retention Policies

The system implements the following retention periods as specified in the continuation request:

- **Interview Data**: 90 days
  - Sessions (`sessions` collection)
  - Assessments (`assessments` collection)  
  - Tokens (`tokens` and `enhanced_tokens` collections)
  - Coding challenges (`coding_challenges` collection)
  - SJT tests (`sjt_tests` collection)

- **Audio Files**: 30 days
  - Voice recordings stored in GridFS
  - Types: `answer_audio`, `question_audio`, `tts_audio`

- **Video Analysis**: 60 days
  - Video analysis data (`video_analysis` collection)
  - Audio analysis metadata (`audio_analysis` collection)

### 2. DataPrivacyManager Class

Located in `/app/backend/server.py`, the `DataPrivacyManager` class provides:

```python
class DataPrivacyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_retention_policies = {
            'interview_data': 90,  # days
            'audio_files': 30,
            'video_analysis': 60
        }
```

#### Key Methods:

- `request_consent(candidate_id, data_types)` - GDPR consent tracking
- `right_to_erasure(candidate_id)` - GDPR Article 17 implementation  
- `cleanup_expired_data()` - Automated data cleanup based on retention policies
- `get_data_retention_status()` - Current data counts and expiration status

### 3. API Endpoints

The following admin endpoints have been added for data privacy management:

#### GET `/api/admin/data-privacy/policies`
Returns current retention policies and compliance information.

#### GET `/api/admin/data-privacy/retention-status`  
Returns current data counts (total and expired) for all data types.

#### POST `/api/admin/data-privacy/request-consent`
Records explicit consent for data collection.

Request body:
```json
{
  "candidate_id": "string",
  "data_types": ["interview_audio", "facial_analysis", "resume_data"]
}
```

#### POST `/api/admin/data-privacy/right-to-erasure/{candidate_id}`
Implements GDPR Article 17 - Right to be forgotten. Deletes all data associated with a candidate.

#### POST `/api/admin/data-privacy/cleanup-expired`
Manually triggers cleanup of expired data based on retention policies.

### 4. Automated Background Cleanup

The system includes an automated background task that:

- Runs every 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- Automatically cleans up expired data based on retention policies
- Logs all cleanup operations to `audit_logs` collection for compliance
- Continues running even if individual operations fail
- Starts automatically when the FastAPI application starts

### 5. Audit Logging

All data privacy operations are logged to the `audit_logs` collection with:

- Action type (data_cleanup, data_erasure, etc.)
- Timestamp
- Results/counts
- Compliance references (GDPR Article 17, etc.)

## Data Flow

### Automatic Cleanup Process

1. **Daily Schedule**: Background task runs every 24 hours
2. **Cutoff Calculation**: Calculates expiration dates based on retention policies
3. **Data Deletion**: 
   - MongoDB collections: Uses `delete_many()` with date filters
   - GridFS audio files: Iterates and deletes expired files
4. **Audit Logging**: Records all cleanup operations
5. **Result Reporting**: Returns counts of deleted records by type

### Right to Erasure Process

1. **Request Received**: Admin triggers erasure for specific candidate
2. **Multi-Collection Cleanup**: Deletes from all relevant collections
3. **GridFS Cleanup**: Removes associated audio files
4. **Audit Trail**: Logs erasure operation for compliance
5. **Result Confirmation**: Returns detailed deletion counts

## Database Collections Affected

### Interview Data (90 days retention)
- `sessions` - Interview session data
- `assessments` - Interview assessment results
- `tokens` - Legacy interview tokens
- `enhanced_tokens` - Enhanced interview tokens
- `coding_challenges` - Coding challenge submissions
- `sjt_tests` - Situational judgment test results

### Audio Files (30 days retention)  
- GridFS files with metadata types:
  - `answer_audio` - Candidate voice responses
  - `question_audio` - AI-generated questions
  - `tts_audio` - Text-to-speech audio files

### Video Analysis (60 days retention)
- `video_analysis` - Facial recognition and engagement data
- `audio_analysis` - Audio processing metadata

### Audit and Compliance
- `consent_records` - GDPR consent tracking
- `audit_logs` - Compliance audit trail

## Compliance Features

### GDPR Compliance
- **Article 17 - Right to Erasure**: Complete candidate data deletion
- **Consent Tracking**: Explicit consent recording and management  
- **Data Minimization**: Automated cleanup based on retention policies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data operations

### CCPA Compliance
- **Right to Delete**: Same implementation as GDPR Article 17
- **Data Inventory**: Retention status monitoring
- **Automated Compliance**: Background cleanup ensures compliance

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested using `/app/test_data_retention_direct.py`:

### Test Results:
✅ Retention policies configuration  
✅ Consent request functionality  
✅ Data retention status monitoring  
✅ Cleanup methods availability  
✅ Right to erasure implementation  
✅ Background task configuration  

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Status Monitoring
Use the retention status endpoint to monitor:
- Total records by data type
- Expired records pending deletion
- Retention policy compliance

### Manual Operations
Administrators can:
- Trigger manual cleanup via API
- Process erasure requests
- Monitor audit logs
- Check compliance status

### Automated Operations
The system automatically:
- Cleans up expired data daily
- Logs all operations for audit
- Maintains compliance without manual intervention

## Configuration

Data retention periods are configured in the `DataPrivacyManager` class:

```python
self.data_retention_policies = {
    'interview_data': 90,  # days
    'audio_files': 30,
    'video_analysis': 60
}
```

To modify retention periods, update these values and restart the application.

## Security Considerations

- All data deletion operations are irreversible
- Audit logs provide complete compliance trail
- Background tasks run with appropriate error handling
- API endpoints require admin authentication
- Sensitive operations are logged for security monitoring

## Integration with Existing System

The data retention implementation integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing MongoDB collections
- GridFS audio storage
- Admin authentication system
- FastAPI application lifecycle
- Existing logging infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Additional compliance requirements (other privacy laws)
- More granular retention policies
- Enhanced audit reporting
- Automated compliance reporting
- Integration with external compliance tools
