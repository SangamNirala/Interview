- **Text Responses**: Language patterns, word choice, communication style

#### Methods:
```python
analyze_big_five(speech_data: dict, video_data: dict, text_responses: list) -> dict
calculate_openness(speech_data, video_data, text_responses) -> float
calculate_conscientiousness(speech_data, text_responses) -> float
calculate_extraversion(speech_data, video_data) -> float
calculate_agreeableness(speech_data, text_responses) -> float
