# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Security validation correctly rejecting invalid passwords with 401 status. ✅ ENHANCED ADMIN UPLOAD: /api/admin/upload-job-enhanced endpoint fully functional with new parameters (include_coding_challenge=true, role_archetype='Software Engineer', interview_focus='Technical Deep-Dive', min_questions=8, max_questions=10). Token generation successful with enhanced features object populated correctly. ✅ CANDIDATE PIPELINE WITH SESSION_ID: /api/admin/candidate-pipeline endpoint working correctly and includes session_id field as required. Pipeline retrieving 7 total candidates with 4 entries containing session_id values. Sample session_id format verified (e.g., 6c29165a...). ✅ DETAILED REPORT API - VALID SESSION: /api/admin/detailed-report/{session_id} endpoint working perfectly. Successfully created complete 8-question interview session and generated detailed report with: 1) Formatted interview transcript in Q1/A1, Q2/A2 format (4582 characters), 2) Complete candidate score breakdown (Technical: 70, Behavioral: 70, Overall: 70), 3) Assessment summary with all required fields (session_id, candidate_name, job_title, interview_date, transcript, assessment_summary, detailed_justification, full_assessment), 4) All core fields present (4/4) and assessment fields present (3/3). ✅ DETAILED REPORT API - ERROR HANDLING: Invalid session ID properly returns 404 status with appropriate error message. ✅ ENHANCED TOKEN GENERATION COMPATIBILITY: Enhanced token system working correctly with backward compatibility maintained. Token validation successful for both enhanced and standard tokens. CONCLUSION: All enhanced admin reporting features are working correctly and provide the requested interview transcript format, candidate score breakdown, and comprehensive assessment data.

    -message: "🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - CANDIDATE INTERVIEW START FAILURE: Comprehensive testing of the reported 'Failed to start interview: TypeError: Failed to fetch' issue reveals the exact root cause. DETAILED FINDINGS: ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING: 1) Backend connectivity confirmed - server responding properly, 2) CORS configuration fixed - frontend domain 'https://e6dea12e-be61-43d4-94a8-32b3f384ad2a.preview.emergentagent.com' properly allowed, 3) Admin authentication working perfectly (Game@1234), 4) Token generation/validation working for both regular and enhanced tokens, 5) Camera test endpoint functional with voice_mode=true. ❌ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: /api/candidate/start-interview endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error due to INVALID GEMINI API KEY. Backend error logs show: 'litellm.AuthenticationError: geminiException - API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.' Direct testing of Gemini API key 'AIzaSyCFYX2-5r3oZH_Z53rl-5-xNaotmBtBhbc' confirms it's invalid (400 status with 'API_KEY_INVALID' error). This prevents interview question generation, causing ALL interview start attempts (text mode, voice mode, enhanced interviews) to fail with 500 errors. IMPACT: Users cannot start interviews because backend cannot generate questions without valid Gemini API. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Generate new valid Gemini API key from Google AI Studio dashboard and update GEMINI_API_KEY in backend/.env file. This is a HIGH PRIORITY blocking issue preventing core interview functionality."

IMPACT: The critical 500 Internal Server Error that was preventing all interview starts has been completely resolved. Users can now successfully start interviews in both text and voice modes. The /api/candidate/start-interview endpoint is fully functional and ready for production use."

Questions properly categorized and delivered in expected sequence. ✅ 6) TOKEN VALIDATION & MANAGEMENT: Enhanced tokens with custom configurations validate correctly. Both enhanced and legacy validation endpoints working. ✅ 7) QUESTION DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION: Verified correct question distribution according to custom configuration specifications.
